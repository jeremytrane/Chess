1. `ChessGame.java`: This file represents the main class that initializes and manages the game. It contains the main method and handles the game loop, user input, and overall game logic.

2. `Board.java`: This file represents the chessboard and its state. It includes methods for initializing the board, updating the positions of pieces, and validating moves.

3. `Piece.java`: This file defines the `Piece` class, which represents a chess piece. It includes properties such as color (black or white) and type (pawn, knight, bishop, etc.), as well as methods for validating moves specific to each piece type.

4. `Player.java`: This file defines the `Player` class, which represents a player in the game. It includes properties like name, color, and methods for making moves and handling the player's turn.

5. `Move.java`: This file defines the `Move` class, which represents a move made by a player. It includes properties like the source and destination squares, the piece being moved, and any captured pieces.

6. `Square.java`: This file defines the `Square` class, which represents a square on the chessboard. It includes properties like the row and column coordinates, as well as methods for checking if a square is occupied and getting the piece on the square.

7. `GameStatus.java`: This file defines the `GameStatus` enum, which represents the current status of the game (e.g., ongoing, checkmate, stalemate, etc.).

Additional Files

8. `UI.java`: This file handles the user interface and displays the chessboard, pieces, and game information. It may include methods for rendering the board, capturing user input, and updating the display.

9. `AIPlayer.java`: If you want to implement an AI opponent, you may need a file that defines the `AIPlayer` class. This class would contain methods for generating AI moves and making decisions based on the current game state.

10. `Persistence.java`: If you want to implement game persistence (e.g., saving and loading game state), you may need a file that defines the `Persistence` class. This class would include methods for saving the game state to a file and loading it back.
